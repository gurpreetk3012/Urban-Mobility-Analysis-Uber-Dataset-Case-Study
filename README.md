# Urban Mobility Analysis: Uber Dataset Case Study

### Uber Trip Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes Uber ride data to uncover meaningful insights about ride frequency, travel behavior, and trip patterns. The analysis includes comprehensive data cleaning, feature extraction, and visualization techniques to help understand how Uber rides vary over time and by purpose.

## 📊 Objective

To analyze Uber ride data to:
- Identify peak travel times and dates
- Understand the distribution of trip purposes
- Analyze trip durations and distances
- Discover user behavior patterns

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Uber Data](https://github.com/gurpreetk3012/Urban-Mobility-Analysis-Uber-Dataset-Case-Study/blob/main/UberDataset.csv)
- **Format:** CSV file containing fields such as Start Date, End Date, Category, Start/Stop Locations, and Purpose

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Unified date formats for consistency
- Extracted features such as:
  - Trip Duration
  - Day of the Week
  - Month and Hour from timestamp fields

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Used Python libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** to:
- Plot trip counts by category and purpose
- Visualize monthly and hourly trends
- Display trip duration distributions
- Explore correlations between features

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Peak ride times occur during working hours and weekdays
- "Business" and "Personal" trips have different patterns
- Most frequent purposes include "Meeting" and "Errand/Supplies"
- Higher ride frequency during certain months and days

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
